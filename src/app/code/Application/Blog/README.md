# MageLens demonstration blog

`Application_Blog` is a sample application for [MageLens](../../../../../README.md). Its PHP controllers, Magento Admin forms, browser JavaScript, and HTML templates provide examples for all three coverage reports.

Browser scenarios live in `Test/Cypress/`; fixture creation, cleanup, and Cypress patches are managed by `Test/MageLens/hooks.php`. See [Use your project](../../../../../docs/coverage.md#use-your-project) to add your own modules and tests.

## Try the demo

From the repository root, run `./install.sh`, then `./bin/run-coverage`.

- Storefront: **https://magelens.test/blog/**.
- Magento Admin: **https://magelens.test/admin/**; local demo credentials are `application` / `ApplicationOnly123456!`.
- Live Cypress runner: **https://magelens.test:6080/**.
- In Admin, open **Blog → Posts**, **Categories**, or **Comments**.
- Reports: open `coverage/index.html` from the repository root after the coverage command finishes.

Use the domain and ports configured in `.env` if you changed the defaults. Installation creates three starter articles once and preserves editorial changes on reruns.

## Demo features

- **Categories:** create, rename, enable or disable categories. An inactive category hides its articles. Move or delete its posts before deleting the category.
- **Posts:** manage title, URL slug, author, summary, plain-text body, category, SEO metadata, and a featured JPEG/PNG image (maximum 5 MB). Admin includes search, pagination, article preview, and word count. Image replacement/removal deletes the previous owned file.
- **Publishing:** save a draft, choose Published for immediate publication, or set a future publication time in **UTC**. Visibility is evaluated on each request, so scheduled posts do not require cron. Draft, future, missing, and inactive-category article URLs return 404.
- **Readers:** search and filter articles, paginate results, expand a quick read, open full article pages, and save favorites in browser storage. Search and category selections survive reloads through URL parameters.
- **Comments:** readers submit a name, private email, and plain-text comment. Comments stay pending until approved in Admin; editors can approve, reject, or delete them. A honeypot and a one-minute session/email cooldown limit repeated submissions. HTML in articles and comments is displayed as text.

Admin uses Magento's normal login, Blog ACL permission, secret URL keys, and form-key validation. Writes use POST, including deletion, which asks for confirmation. Grant **Manage Blog** in an Admin role to allow editing; a dashboard-only role cannot access Blog management. Uploaded files are validated as images and stored under random names in `pub/media/application/blog/`.

Content is shared across this installation's store views, with one category per post. Articles and comments use plain text. This demo is intended for local development.

## What Cypress verifies

Five tests exercise storefront discovery, favorites, pagination, publication visibility, Admin creation/editing/deletion, image upload/removal, SEO output, moderated comments, input validation, escaped output, CSRF rejection, and restricted-role authorization. They use real Magento forms and HTTP requests. One test publishes an article in Admin, reads it on the storefront, submits and moderates a comment, and removes its records.

Each run creates uniquely named fixtures and a temporary dashboard-only Admin account. Cleanup removes that run's posts, comments, images, categories, user, and role, preserving ordinary application content. Fixture metadata in Magento's `var/` allows the next run to clean up after an interrupted process.

## Source layout

| Path | Demonstrates |
| --- | --- |
| `Model/`, `ViewModel/` | Publishing rules, validation, and data access |
| `Controller/`, `Block/` | Storefront HTTP requests and Magento Admin actions |
| `etc/`, `Setup/` | Module configuration, declarative schema, and initial demo articles |
| `view/frontend/` | PHP page templates, AMD JavaScript, Knockout templates, and an Underscore template |
| `view/adminhtml/` | Admin forms, preview JavaScript, and browser templates |
| [Demo theme](../../../design/frontend/Application/coverage/) | Magento Blank extension, LESS styles, and the `theme-note.html` browser template |

Edit these tracked files under `src/`. Installation copies them into `.runtime/app/` for execution; coverage instruments only the disposable copies and verifies the originals afterward. Rerun `./install.sh` after changes to refresh Magento setup and assets.
